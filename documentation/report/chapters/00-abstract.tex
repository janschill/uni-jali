Modern techniques to perform DOM updates on rendered HTML documents mostly use a VDOM with comparison of two views: the current view and an updated one after an action is performed. The comparison of tree-structures with subsequent patching of the structure and rerendering is computational expensive. With clever compiler optimizations using partial evaluation these comparisons can be reduced. An action should always make changes in a predictable manner and in the same position in the DOM. With partial evaluation the expensive comparison can be precomputed at compile time and reduced to a single direct change that circumvents the update-model-view cycle.
This paper will cover this compile time optimization and the generation of JavaScript snippets, with which the change can be performed and demonstrate that the VDOM comparison can be prevented to a certain degree. The paper will not introduce the compiler to JavaScript that would generate a complete working program for the browser.
