Modern techniques to perform DOM updates on rendered HTML documents mostly use a VDOM with comparison of two views, the current view and an updated one after an action is performed. The comparison of tree-structures with subsequent patching of the structure and rerendering is computational expensive. With clever compiler optimizations using partial evaluation these comparisons can be reduced, as the result of an action should always only change in a predictable manner and in the same position in the DOM, hence only a comparison during compile time is needed and thus reduced to a single direct change.
This paper will cover the compiler optimization and the generation of JavaScript snippets, with which the change can be performed, but will not introduce a compiler to JavaScript that would generate a complete working program for the browser.
